For each of these skills, write pseudo-code (like the post = Post.all.first example above) to demonstrate how your application might perform these tasks through an ORM. 
For each code sample, also write a corresponding SQL statement. 

1.remove duplicates in a query response

2.filter records using inequalities, pattern matching, ranges, and boolean logic

3.sort records in a particular order

4.limit the number of records returned

5.group records into sections

6.perform calculations using aggregate functions

7.join tables using cross join, inner join, and outer join
